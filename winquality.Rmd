Setting the Packages
----------------------
```{r}
install.packages('neuralnet')

#Activate
library(neuralnet)
```

Reading in the Data
------------------------
```{r}
data = read.csv('winequality-white.csv')

#View the structure of the dataframe
str(data)
summary(data)

plot(data$quality)
```
From the scatter plot we see that Data Quality, which we are wanting to predict, is quite thin at the ends.
We are then wanting to bin Quality into 3 bins, 1, 2, 3

Binning Quality
-----------------------
```{r}
attach(data)
data$quality_bin[quality < 4] <- 1
data$quality_bin[quality > 3 & quality < 7] <- 2
data$quality_bin[quality > 6] <- 3
View(data)
plot(data$quality_bin)

```
